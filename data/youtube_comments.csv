BUT i am getting huge no.of doubts and iam unable solve those. the java tutors in google are working for money and NOT for the students future. please change the WAY of TEACHING in INDIA. even though the videos might very very LENGTHY we want the beautiful and crystal clear explanation. i think u know about DURGA SOFT his videos are very lengthy . even though they are very lengthy that is the top channel for programming in india. please make very crystal clear explanation of Java even the videos are lengthy. people want the concept not length. even we pay you the FEE for the videos because it needs a very hard work TO teach. hope u will will conduct instructor led classess. thank u very much . i will share this video to all of friends and family members and also to people whom i dont know.

Since the time complexity of this algorithm is not polynomial, AFAIK we can just find the MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) and can add the Cost from last vertex to the source to the final result. This way we can have only O(E log V) complexity? Please correct me if i'm wrong?",1

Using recursion and memoization is the top-to-bottom approach of dynamic programming, and using iterative approach and table is the bottom-to-top approach of dynamic programming. Isn't it?

You can put person A into, let's say a capitalist, while person B into, let's say a socialist simply by taking their common used words and the ""passion / positivity"" of the word commonly used by capitalist / socialist. It's one of the tool China used to censor people. Like any technology, it can be used for good or bad. The problem with speech is that it maybe sarcastic, that is where NLP still fail.",1

This series was done in 2014 and is now outdated. Do not follow his setup instructions they are no longer correct. Find someone's newer vid for set up! The rest of his series past setting up Java and Eclipse is probably okay to watch I doubt that much has changed about actual programming. Just the setting up of JDK & IDE.,0

Not the best tutorial for beginners. Luckily i loaded up multiple tutorials from YouTube with plans to watch them all to see who would teach better. I watched Corey Schafer&#39;s tutorial first and is much easier to understand since he uses HTML language to explain how to target what you want from the html. His workflow is also easier to understand. Still appreciate the effort here .,0
Why am I watching instead of doing my actual math test which is a lot easier,0

"VPN is bullshit. they provide neither anonymity nor security. VPN was made to securely access a remote network. Your IP isn't as important as they make it out to be. if you want anonymity use tor. if you want to mask your ip, use a proxy (or tor). your browser sends a load of information that can be used to identify you uniquely, from the version and operating system in the user agent to screen resolution, supported ciphers and loads of other stuff. cookies can be used to track you easily. as soon as you log in they know who you are anyway. as for security... it does nothing. packets are encrypted with vpn to the vpn server and then the vpn layer is decrypted. that's not a problem since 99.5% of the internet uses TLS with AES anyway. It doesn't protect you from scams, downloading viruses or entering your credit card information on fake banking sites. Also instead of your ISP getting all of your DNS requests, the vpn server gets them (as well as all 100% of your decrypted (vpn layer only, obviously) traffic), so who do you trust more? I'd rather trust myself. If you do want your dns records secure just set up a recursive dns server. i have one running on my raspberry pi as well as my own openvpn server. and not because of the bullshit reasons vpn companies sell you but because to access my own network (printer, network storage, etc) from remote. So instead of selling that vpn snakeoil, how about you choose your sponsors more carefully. at least raid shadow legends is providing a game, however shitty, instead of taking your money for nothing except for a slower internet connection and potential security risk. And yes, using VPN is a security risk. You're literally plugging a (virtual) lan cable into their vpn server, bypassing any and all protection layers like your router's NAS firewall and IDS and instead rely on theirs. I can connect to my home VPN server all I want because I know it's secure and it has snort ids set up (on the raspberry), pi hole (on the pi), my nextcloud storage and webserver (on the pi), the recursive dns server (on the pi), etc. So literally buy a raspberry pi for 40 bucks and you get more value out of it than all the fucking vpn salesmen in the world. and even if you don't you don't get anything. vpn providers have a place, but it's not like everybody needs it or their data gets stolen by hackers. that's not how hacking works, or vpn. you go to a malicious website that exploits some vulnerability in your browser or execute a virus or run an vulnerable service like a game server or something and the hacker just gets the data through the vpn tunnel just like anything else. The best defense is not vpn, it's brain.exe running properly. and that includes not buying this bullshit. so stop promoting it. please. PS: also just because raid shadow legends is better than vpn... please do not promote that garbage either. and although i'm sick of hearing it, audibile and brilliant at least offer something sensible. PPS: Just for promoting this garbage i'm gonna vote down. although I know that still counts as interaction and youtube doesn't care.",0

"Hello, I just watched your this clip. In first it was very interesting because right now I am going to give my Exam and your tips on exam day was very good but after tip#9, everything changed and you come with preparing for test. In your last tip making people demotivate.",0
Honestly I was hoping to see something new but all these tips are same as every other tips I have seen on YouTube,0
Waste of time.. whatever u spoke has been written in every IELTS book as tips.. Expected you to come up with a new strategy.. something different than the usual. ðŸ˜–,0
this is basic overall ielts formats but nothing about reading section in details mentioned above content :(,0
I practiced alot but my score didn't improve..,0

Good tips but youuu knnowwww itâ€™s irritating to hear that yoouuu knowwww so many times!,0
"your English accent is rubbish, you ruined the language, if I were you I would deliver my message through writing",0
"Tomorrow I will be taking my toefl exam, and the scariest section of it for me is speaking, I am a very talkative person I don't have trouble expressing my ideas but the most challenging thing for me in speaking is the time given to prepare the answer I just get stuck and can't come up with ideas knowing that I have literally 15 seconds to prepare an accurate and complete response with 250 words. I just don't know how to overcome this.",0
Iâ€™m taking my test in a month and Iâ€™m still bad at the speakingðŸ˜”,0
"i can speak with my mexican accent, but when i'm in front of the computer i get nervous and speak like an idiot :(",0
The link to download the new test doesn't work.,0
I am struggling with the ideas for examplesðŸ˜ž,0
"And here I am, unable to stop talking after my time is over :)",0
Everyone got good scores in the comments Iâ€™m nervous I got a 23 last time :(,0
1:05 that sound effect scared the shit out of me.,0
"Hi there, just asked for the free practice pack. The speaking is carrying a virus, can't download it. What a pity....",0
"The problem with me is my brain stops working when Iâ€™m asked, ask me when Iâ€™m at lunch what do I think about schools uniforms and Iâ€™ll never stop talking but when a toefl question me Iâ€™m gonna be a two year old kid",0
"This is the first time I'm seeing someone coding in Java, don't know Java but man, Java is complicating everything.",0

this is just a long advertisement. not even close to data structures and algorithms. big spam. use less.,0
I think this tutorial is over produced. But good info.,0
Tried Array numbers = new Array(length:3); doesn't work... i am getting the error create a local var,0
To bad is java not C# :( or Ts,0
Much worried that there are only few videos on JAVA .,0
"the real shit in my school is they teaching so many language. in my 1st sem they teach c++ basics in 2nd sem they teach data structure of java and simple python like atm machine , calculator ,and pygame",0
"ðŸ˜ why it's not in C, CPP or Python. I am so frustrated because this the best DS course in the YouTube but it Java. I am so angry on you sir. Pls do something. Edit: And this is the only freaking reason I'm not able to buy this whole course. Pls help",0

"Well, that moment when you ask your parents for Christmas, a SUBSCRIPTION to watch Mosh courses. As soon as I saw you had a video about this topic. Instantly bought a subscription to your courses and told my parents it would be my christmas gift. :D Thanks this would be much appreciated since I am having troubles with how my teacher explain this at the university. Lots of variables with a,b,c,s,kmnnakfwofkvms and no real examples.",0
Front end development hell hard ðŸ˜”,0

Fuck React! Vue is the king.,0

"maybe I`m living in higly compete coutry but real requirements for Junior is not the same like in video. first of all Junior must be able to solve programming problems on JS, he (she) must has knowladge in algorytms and technologies like Bootstrap 4, WebPack, Jade\Pug, Gulp will be a plus. So, the video really weak.",0
To be honest to get job in web development u need to learn many languages perfectly and thats not easy for everyone,0
Web development:- website development is very hard Mosh:- are kidding me .....,0
Girls can't code lol,0
Warning : this video isn't for beginners .,0
I write in emacs the second problem (with random numbers) but when i run it in the ubuntu terminal it shows nothing,0
she's good at programming not at teaching,0
I can't get the tiktaktoe right no matter what I do ;-;,0
The TicTacToe Is hard. I'll keep trying.,0
was really hyped to watch the video saw the dab:returned back to the youtube homepage,0
Am not getting the output to rock paper scissor,0
So sadness if you say that binary code is machine languages. Binary code is just a symbol.,0
"For guess a number, user edition, I am getting a syntax error in the high = guess - 1 and low = guess + 1.I am getting 2 other problems despite copying the code completely ditto.",0
"Sorry!!! My issue is with Guess the Number (not getting 2nd part to run, as it only runs first part)",0
"The second part ""computer guess"", doesn't run. I even copied it from github. Keeps running DEF guess(x) only, I'm using Pycharm. Any thoughts would greatly be appreciated.",0
nice but confusing,0
Your codes are daamnn complicated,0
"I called 'player.py', 'tic-tac-toe.py' and then I rename 'tic_tac_toe.py'. But i still have the same problem of 'unresolved reference'.",0
In tic-tac-toe I created 2 different python file and I wrote the same things like u but I got this error message: x_player = HumanPlayer('X') NameError: name 'HumanPlayer' is not defined,0
Oh my god... a forget a 'n' in 'randint'. How a silly error could give so much headache? kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk ... But my code isn't functioning yet.,0
I'm guessing beginners who have had months of practice?? You go way to fast.,0
@kylie ying You single? hahah. Wicked tutorial.,0
"I think any true beginner would be lost by the time they reach Tic-Tac-Toe. The problems are fairly simple, but the solutions provided seem much more advanced than a beginner level. For any beginner watching, the pace is extremely fast and hard to follow if they are hoping to learn anything. Theres many likes on this video, so perhaps this is not an overly popular opinion, but it seems to me this is more like ""Advanced (or moderate) solutions to Beginner problems"". Kylie is clearly very knowledgeable , but this is certainly not a 2nd step following Mike Danes course in the path to learning Python https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org",0
got completely lost at tic tac toe,0
The Tic Tac Game is definitely hard to code. Not really for beginners.,0
"That Hangman game was too hard for me to actually win, sadly :D",0
"I really dislike the fact that you stopped live-coding your projects after the fourth project, but still a good presentation",0
"I appreciate the video but it doesn't need 3 hours to go through this, you could have just shared your code. To make it truly presentation worthy, consider making animations and videos. Teaching others isn't just about talking about what you know in my opinion. See 3blue1Brown as the perfect example.",0
Noise,0
i aint got no mac,0
Got lost in TicTacToe,0
I was thinking about study python....but after you re coding...suicide is betterðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«,0
So you think this is for beginner ?,0
damn that tic tac toe is hard man!,0
if this is for beginners then i'm in trouble... lol... i thought this was going to be way easier than VBA...,0
Getting an error that TicTacToe is not defined.,0
"Im doing CS in school, python looks fun but when trying myself i couldnt do anything but understand almost everything when wathing. Also python felt very complicated downloading, i think im gonna unistall it and it will trash my computer down with left over files everywere.",0
Dab was to hard. Had to take a break,0
i have a confusion,0
I cringed soo hard in the intro ;(,0
"As much as I want to like this video, I just can't follow. I must be below beginner level. I'm at the Tic Tac Toe project and I'm completely lost. I don't understand what you're typing or why lol I'll come back later I guess.",0
I hate snakes so no Python for me.,0
Me (in theory): Wow! Great course and intro to scripting! Me (in reality): Can't even get the SDK install or find the required libraries/modules ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,0
That dab ruined my whole excitement for this video,0
This information should be illegal because now prosecutors will have a hard time convicting real criminals committing cyber crimes due to the fact that programmers / coders have the power and knowledge to frame anyone.,0
Beginner - A person just starting to learn a skill or take part in an activity. Nothing in this video relates to beginners.,0
no video time stamps no watch,0
i can't believe the amount of commercials this video has... one for each type of algorithm... annoying.,0
Hiring is completely broken in the software industry.,0
"Basically, master Data Structures and Algorithms. The class I did the worst in and have the most difficult time understanding. RIP",0
Stupid Youtube advertisement.,0
"Your arrogance is a bit annoying, TL. But thanks for letting me know how I apparently have to behave to get a job.",0
"I know all of these algorithms, but I flunked Microsoft's interview. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",0

"The Samsung would have about 1 to 1.5 hrs of additional screen on time . To say one is a one day phone , the other a two day phone is just plain ridiculous ðŸ¤¬ðŸ‘Ž",0
"Your words ""all phones now a days are pretty much exactly the same two sheets of glass around aluminium centre"" (something along those lines) your opening statement ""these two phone designs couldn't be more different"" is it me or have you already just made yourself look like a fool? Dislike ðŸ‘ŽðŸ¼ bye bye ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼",0
this is an anoying video becasue I agree with everything you say. I personally fall directly into the Samsung category. problem is... I hate samsung.,0
Biased towards OnePlus,0
"OnePlus 9 Pro was quite disappointing. It was supposed to wow us, and make us want one, but the Hasselblad partnership clearly didn't work out so well",0
"I'm done with FlopPlus and Shanshung. Slow update, and their stable update is making their phone slower with tons of bugs.",0
"What I dislike now is the ""chunk"" in the rear camera module corner in many models... It's getting so that you have to invest in a thick case that will surround that corner just to lay the unit completely flat...Once again, Apple initially started all that garbage!",0
OnePlus x Hasselblad doesn't live up to the hype,0
"Serious question: are you a youtuber or a programmer or a teacher... pick one. Stop switching from code to you, what a waste of time. Also you have just made 3 classes for 3 enemies. Why Dude ? Where does this make sense? Because if we was to make a game with your logic of thinking and we had 1000 different types, thats 1001 enemy files including the original..",0
bullshit. you didnt get point of 3 of 4 pillars,0
"What's kind of frustrating to me is that this is an interview question. However as a kinetic learner, I've already been doing all of this, but until now I'd never have been able to explain what these 4 things were... aside from inheritance that is.",0
"Every video on YouTube gets Abstraction WRONG. Information hiding is done through Encapsulation. Abstraction is constraining information to that which is relevant to your application. So, for example, the weight of a Person would be relevant to a Fitness and not a Banking.app i.e. they will have different abstractions of a Person.",0
I hate programming.,0
Python. I do not have to worry about semicolons,0
I'm surprised this didn't include interfaces and abstract classes in the explanation for abstraction. Otherwise great explanation!,0
Your video is not relevant to your content,0
I didnt understand why I should start late?,0
Distraction is my biggest problemðŸ¤§ðŸ¤§ðŸ¤§,0
"The toefl test is a fraud, they won't even let you listen to your own recordings. They just disappear and come up with a score out of the nowhere. Of corse, if you think you were haphazardly assessed, you'll have to pay an additional 80 dollar fee for them to actually do their job. Total fraud. Pay more= higher score. Scammers",0
Bro gamil confirm msg hast come yet.its already 2 days .mis I tried ur ymg..site but it is not either confirming it nor it let me see,0
We can not apply for fall 2020 or spring 2021?,0

"Its Usually the Pune University students who have low CGPA, it has worst grading system, if these students were to attend any other universities the results would be surprising. And its very common, students of pune University have similar CGPA as the guys in video shown have(who are also from PU BTW) and yet get admit to top 100 US universities.",0
The pressure of all these applications is making me suicidal,0
"applied to csuFu , 296 gre 7.4 cgpa. got rejected.",0
I don't think so... its right,0
My problem is that I dont understand anythink ðŸ˜‚,0
I got 18 points... I think most of the wrong answers were because I FORGOT what was said ðŸ˜­,0
"This is not fair. This test isn't about English. It's about memory. I can understand every single word, but keeping that amount of information is like reading a page about an specific topic in one go and absorbing everything you read. The astronomy class was savage. I'm not taking TOEFL any time soon, or else I'd need to learn how to take notes.",0
"I need to learn to take notes faster, otherwise I'm not gonna be able to answer all the questions, I have a fish memory ðŸ¤§",0
"I understand every words, but I can't remember",0
Can't download the answers,0
Itâ€™s too hard. I just answered 13 correct questions.,0

It's too hard . Now i'm afraid of taking this testðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨,0
But Its too difficult,0
"I appreciate the video Josh. However, I think itÂ´s very unrealistic and most of the question choices are extremely similar (The Toefl does not try to do this very often). Otherwise, all the other videos that you make are top-notch :)",0
"oh God, this is so much more difficult than I thought... It goes SO fast wtf??? I can't make notes because of that..",0
This is bullshit,0
I got 17/28 I am some confusion for lectures 3 and 5. thanks,0
24/28 kinda disappointed on myself tbh :(,0
"18 out of 30,. Not so proud!",0
"To be honest this exam does not size up any of the actual listening abilities.. (you know we all understand every word) so the trick is obviously *not to assess what you heard, but what it might imply* this is why you might find up to even 3 true answers per question, plus the ridiculous amount of little time to pick an aswer.. maybe this ETS TOEFL business rejects the fact that almost everyone would get quite the max punctuations if the test was logic and utterly a *listening* exam. No surprise even natives fail and find this exercise frustrating..! Come on teachers, it's only english.. even dogs understand it, what is the purpose of making it complicated..??",0
Sometimes I feel like my English has really advanced even my accent has reduced and all good but other times I feel so fool ðŸ™,0
I just got 20/30 :(,0
"I did it, but I wanted to compare the answers. I'm disappointed.",0
Didn't receive the PDF. I am gonna take the test on Jan 12. I am really nervous.,0
"lesson 2 question 4... the first thing that university/school/etc, science class teach us is that theory is not hypothesis... Not fair.",0
"thank you very much , but i can't download the pdf ?",0
"I scored 21, not so good...",0
Got so many wrong but in the listening part from ETS Official Toefl book I almost got everything right... is that better? Have my test next week :( so nervous,0
I m very week English ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,0
Dude.. wtf! I got the same 2nd question regarding the origin of moon on my actual TOEFL test! Unreal!,0
24/28 there remain 3 days to my exam so i am frustrated because my goal is to score 24+ on the listening section,0

"Practise, practise, practise, I couldn't agree more! All the tips and strategies that I learnt in my first attempt were useless (sometimes even detrimental, instead of using a strategy, I thought of that strategy during the test, which wasted time ðŸ˜¤).
